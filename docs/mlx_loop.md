### Synopsis
```
int mlx_loop(void *mlx_ptr);

int mlx_key_hook(void *win_ptr, int (*funct_ptr)(), void *param);

int mlx_mouse_hook(void *win_ptr, int (*funct_ptr)(), void *param);

int mlx_expose_hook(void *win_ptr, int (*funct_ptr)(), void *param);

int mlx_loop_hook(void *mlx_ptr, int (*funct_ptr)(), void *param);
```

### Events
Both X-Window and MacOSX graphical systems are bi-directionnal.

On one hand, the program sends orders to the screen to display pixels, images, and so on. 

On the other hand, it can get information from the keyboard and mouse associated to the screen. To do so, the program receives "events" from the keyboard or the mouse.

### Description
To receive events, you must use `mlx_loop`. This function never returns. It is an infinite loop that waits for an event, and then calls a user-defined function associated with this event. A single parameter is needed, the connection identifier mlx_ptr (see the [mlx man page](mlx.md)).

You can assign different functions to the three following events:
- A key is pressed
- The mouse button is pressed
- A part of the window should be re-drawn (this is called an "expose" event, and it is your program's job to handle it).

Each window can define a different function for the same event.

The three functions `mlx_key_hook`, `mlx_mouse_hook` and `mlx_expose_hook` work exactly the same way. `funct_ptr` is a pointer to the function you want to be called when an event occurs. This assignment is specific to the window defined by the `win_ptr` identifier. The `param` address will be passed to the function everytime it is called, and should be used to store the parameters it might need.

The syntax for the `mlx_loop_hook` function is identical to the previous ones, but the given function will be called when no event occurs.

When it catches an event, the MiniLibX calls the corresponding function with fixed parameters:
```
int expose_hook(void *param);

int key_hook(int keycode,void *param);

int mouse_hook(int button,int x,int y,void *param);

int loop_hook(void *param);
```

These function names are arbitrary. They are used to distinguish parameters according to the event. These functions are NOT part of the MiniLibX.

`param` is the address specified in the `mlx_*_hook` calls. This address is never used nor modified by the MiniLibX.

On key and mouse events, additional information is passed: `keycode` tells you which key is pressed (X11: look for the include file "keysymdef.h", MacOS: create a small software and find out by yourself), (`x`,`y`) are the coordinates of the mouse click in the window, and `button` tells you which mouse button was pressed.

### Going further with events
The MiniLibX provides a much more generic access to all type of events. The mlx.h include define `mlx_hook` in the same manner `mlx_*_hook` functions work. The event and mask values will be taken from the X11 include file "X.h" (even for MacOSX, for compatibility purposes)

See source code of `mlx_int_param_event.c` to find out how the MiniLibX will call your own function for a specific event.

### Additional notes (not in the manual)
The "expose" event is triggered, for example, when the window is brought into focus.

If you register more than one function to an event, only the last function will be called.

The C language provides a way to group data together in a way that allows you to pass it all to a single `param`.

#### mlx_hook
```
int mlx_hook(void *win_ptr, int x_event, int x_mask, int (*funct)(), void *param);
```
`x_mask` is ignored on MacOSX.

If you look up what's in "X.h", you'll find some really important events.

Mouse movement: `x_event = 6`, the function will be called like this:
```
int mouse_move(int x, int y, void *param);
```
Close button: `x_event = 17`, the function will be called like this:
```
int close_program(void *param);
```
And more, but these are by far the most useful for early projects.
