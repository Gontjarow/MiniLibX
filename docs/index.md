### What is it?
A small library which implements some basic functions that allow you to quickly open a window and to draw within it.

More specifically, it's an abstraction of the "X Window System" for Unix platforms.

Recommended watching: "Introduction to MinilibX" and "Introduction to events" on the school intra.
